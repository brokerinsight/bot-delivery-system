# ✅ TypeScript Nodemailer Fix - SUCCESS REPORT

## 🎉 Problem Resolved Successfully!

**Date**: August 10, 2025  
**Issue**: Digital Ocean TypeScript compilation error with nodemailer module  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND VERIFIED**

---

## 📋 Original Problem

The application was failing to build on Digital Ocean App Platform with this error:

```bash
./src/lib/email.ts:1:24
Type error: Could not find a declaration file for module 'nodemailer'. 
'/workspace/node_modules/nodemailer/lib/nodemailer.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
Try `npm i --save-dev @types/nodemailer` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing `declare module 'nodemailer';`

> 1 | import nodemailer from 'nodemailer';
    |                        ^
  2 | import { CustomBotOrder } from '@/types';

Next.js build worker exited with code: 1 and signal: null
building: exit status 1
```

---

## 🔧 Solution Applied

**Root Cause**: Digital Ocean's Node.js buildpack was excluding `@types/nodemailer` from `devDependencies` during TypeScript compilation.

**Fix**: Moved `@types/nodemailer` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in `package.json`

### Changes Made:

```json
// Before (in devDependencies)
"devDependencies": {
  "@types/nodemailer": "^6.4.0"
}

// After (in dependencies) 
"dependencies": {
  "@types/nodemailer": "^6.4.0"
}
```
