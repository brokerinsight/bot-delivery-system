# Redis Migration Fix Guide

## Issue Summary
The migration from Valkey to Upstash Redis caused connection issues because the new implementation was trying to parse a `REDIS_URL` format, but Upstash Redis REST API actually uses different environment variables.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Reverted redis-client.js** to use `Redis.fromEnv()` method which automatically reads the correct Upstash environment variables
2. **Updated error handling** to check for the correct Upstash-specific error messages
3. **Updated .env.example** to show the correct environment variable format

## Required Environment Variables

You need to update your `.env` file with the following Upstash Redis REST API credentials:

```env
# Remove the old REDIS_URL variable
# REDIS_URL=rediss://default:password@endpoint.upstash.io:6379

# Add these new variables from your Upstash console
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-endpoint.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-redis-rest-token
```

## How to Get Your Credentials

1. Go to [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/)
2. Click on your Redis database
3. In the database details page, find the **REST API** section
4. Copy the values for:
   - **UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL** (the HTTPS endpoint)
   - **UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN** (the authorization token)

## Verify the Fix

After updating your environment variables and restarting your server:

1. Check that virus.html can load data properly
2. Check that index.html connections work
3. Monitor the server logs for successful Redis connections

## Benefits of This Approach

- **No connection drops**: REST API is HTTP-based, not TCP-based
- **Better for serverless**: No connection management needed
- **Automatic retry logic**: Built into the redis-client.js wrapper
- **Simpler configuration**: Just two environment variables needed
