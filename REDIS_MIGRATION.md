# Redis Migration to Upstash

## Overview
Your application has been successfully migrated from the previous Redis/Valkey setup to Upstash Redis using the REST connection. This provides better stability and eliminates connection drops.

## Required Environment Variables

You only need to add these two environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-instance.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

## How to Get These Values

1. Log in to your Upstash console at https://console.upstash.com/
2. Create a new Redis database or select an existing one
3. In the database details page, you'll find:
   - **REST URL**: This is your `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
   - **REST Token**: This is your `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`

## What Changed

1. **Redis Client**: Now uses Upstash Redis REST client (HTTP-based)
2. **Session Store**: Custom implementation for Upstash compatibility
3. **Connection Type**: Hardcoded to REST for stability
4. **Error Handling**: Enhanced with automatic retry logic
5. **No More Connection Drops**: REST connections don't maintain persistent connections

## Features

- ✅ Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Session management with TTL support
- ✅ Rate limiting functionality preserved
- ✅ Caching with expiration support
- ✅ No connection drops
- ✅ Works behind firewalls and proxies

## Removed Dependencies

You can now remove these from your package.json if desired:
- `redis`
- `connect-redis`

## Testing

After adding the environment variables, restart your server and verify:
1. Sessions are working properly
2. Rate limiting is functional
3. Caching is operational
4. No Redis connection errors in logs

## Benefits of REST Connection

1. **No Connection Drops**: HTTP requests are stateless
2. **Better for Cloud**: Works well with cloud platforms
3. **Simpler**: No connection pool management
4. **Reliable**: Each request is independent
5. **Firewall Friendly**: Uses standard HTTPS port

Your application is now configured to use Upstash Redis with REST connection for maximum stability.
