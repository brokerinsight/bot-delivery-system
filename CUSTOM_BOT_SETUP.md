# Custom Bot Feature Setup Instructions

## Database Setup

**IMPORTANT**: Before the custom bot functionality will work, you need to run the SQL schema in your Supabase database.

### Step 1: Run Database Schema

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire content from `database_setup.sql`
4. Run the SQL to create the necessary tables and functions

This will create:
- `custom_bot_orders` table with all required fields
- `refund_reasons` table with default refund options
- Proper indexes for performance
- Row Level Security policies
- Automatic timestamp updates

### Step 2: Environment Variables

Make sure these environment variables are set in your `.env.local`:

```env
# Supabase (required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Site URL (required for emails)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Email configuration (required for notifications)
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@domain.com
SMTP_PASS=your_email_password

# Payment providers (same as your current setup)
PAYHERO_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
PAYHERO_PAYMENT_URL=your_payment_url
PAYHERO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
```
